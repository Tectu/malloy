# Coding Style
Unless noted otherwise, adhere to STL coding style.

# Overview
- Use `snake_case`.
- Don't wrap at 80 characters. It's not 1987 anymore.
- Have an empty line at the end of a file.
- No empty lines at the beginning of a file.
- The opening curly braces of function bodies and class/enum/structs/namespaces are on a separate line.
- `if`/`else` statement bodies with just one instruction shall omit the curly braces.
- Setters are prefixed with `set_`.
